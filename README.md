Web-app that allows you to see any dogs that are checked in at a dog park.  

Specifically dreamed up for the dog park at Westhills Apartment Homes in Lakewood, CO, which is big enough for no more than about 10 dogs to comfortably play.

MVP should:
- Allow users to view the dogs that are currently checked in at the park
- Allow users to enter their dogâ€™s name and size.
- Allow users to check their dog in for a specified amount of time, or until they check out.


Additional functionality:
- Allow users to sign up, and log in.
- Allow users to upload a picture of their dog to use as an avatar,
- or, short of that, users should be able to choose an avatar, from a preselected list of pictures.
- Allow users to set up play dates in advance (same day or within 7 days or something like that).
